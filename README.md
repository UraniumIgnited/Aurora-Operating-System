# Aurora-Operating-System
This is a virtual machine like operating system written in python and it uses pygame and tkinter and other imports to make it as good as possible, please do not with this you will have to be able to install all of the required modules for this to make it work


# Aurora
## Operating System

### Current Update
##### The System works, if you are on windows you can use the .bat file to start the program and if you are on linux or mac you need to use the main.py file


#
### How to Run?
##### Windows
On windows this program and be run throught the start.bat file located in the main area ``` ./start.bat ``` or you can use ``` python main.py ``` to directly launch the main.py file of the program

##### Linux
On Linux you will have to run the command ``` python3 main.py ```, linux does not support .bat files as they are a windows file type.
 You might be able to use a windows file simulator to run the start.bat file but you should just stick with the command shown above if you don't want the pain of that

##### Mac
On Mac it is similar to linux. The commands ``` python3 main.py ``` and ``` python main.py ``` both work again mac does not support .bat files as they are windows file types

##### Option 2
Downloading using wget, unfortunatly I have no idea for that one but I believe it to be something along the lines of ``` wget github.com/UraniumIgnited/Aurora-Operating-System ```.

##### What Option is easier
The Easiest option is downloading it as a .zip file as it is both more reliable and easier to do.
